                        You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
                        Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
                      </p>

                        Suppose you have <code>n</code> versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
                        You are given an API <code>bool isBadVersion(version)</code> which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version.
                      </p>
                      <p class='mt-3'>
                        You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
